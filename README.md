## Hi there 👋, I'm Shivendra Narayan Tripathi

🚀 Learning Machine Learning & AI, along with DSA and Web Development | Btech Student | Exploring ML, DL, NLP

Welcome to my GitHub!  
Here you’ll find my journey from building ML models from scratch → to Deep Learning → to creative real-time projects.  

and the general purpose projects that i will be doing.
